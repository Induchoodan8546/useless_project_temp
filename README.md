## Project Description

Chithraguptan is a 3D virtual pet that lives inside your web browser. He's a temperamental digital being who reacts to your mouse movements and hand gestures, displaying a range of emotions from happy contentment to furious anger. He's the useless companion you never knew you needed for your lonely browsing sessions.

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)

The modern digital workspace is a cold, heartless void. Your frantic mouse movements and gestures go completely unjudged. Who is there to get angry when you ignore them for 15 seconds to watch a video? Who is there to appreciate your sudden, chaotic cursor wiggles? This is a critical lack of emotional accountability in computing.

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)

I present Chithraguptan, a divine being reincarnated as a 3D browser pet, to solve this non-existent problem. He silently observes your every digital twitch, providing the emotional feedback you never asked for. He gets angry if you ignore him and playful if you give him attention, perfectly simulating a real pet without the allergies, the vet bills, or the mess.

## Technical Details

### Technologies/Components Used

**For Software:**

- **Languages:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript  
- **Frameworks/Libraries:**  
  - **three.js:** For all 3D rendering, geometry, and scene management.  
  - **Tailwind CSS:** For styling the user interface elements.  
  - **MediaPipe (by Google):** For real-time, in-browser hand tracking and gesture recognition.  
- **Tools:** Visual Studio Code, Web Browser with WebGL support

**For Hardware:**

- A standard webcam (for hand gesture control)  
- A mouse (for cursor control)

## Implementation

This project is a self-contained web application and requires no complex installation.

**For Software:**

### Installation

No installation needed! Just download the `index.html` file.

### Run

Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge) that supports WebGL and has permission to access your webcam.

## Project Documentation

**For Software:**

### Screenshots

- The 'Angry' mood, triggered by a fist gesture or inactivity. The pet turns red, frowns, and displays angry eyebrows.  
- Hand Gesture Control is active, with the live webcam feed visible in the top-right corner for real-time interaction.

### Diagrams

- A simple workflow diagram showing how user input is processed to update the pet's mood and render the final animation.

**For Hardware:**  
(Not applicable, as this is a software-only project.)
